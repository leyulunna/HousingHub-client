# HousingHub Client – Frontend

This repository contains the frontend client for the HousingHub project. It is built with React and connects to the Machine Learning API backend for property-price prediction and interactive visualizations.

While this repo focuses primarily on the UI, user interactions, and API integrations, I also contributed to the backend API services. My backend work includes implementing and integrating REST API endpoints that expose the Machine Learning team’s model outputs to the frontend, ensuring smooth end-to-end data flow between the ML service and the user interface.

The backend ML API repository is here:

👉 **Machine Learning API Repo:** https://github.com/leyulunna/housinghub_backend  

This repo focuses on the **user interface**, **API integration**, and **interactive visualizations**.

## 📺 Demo Overview

This demo shows how the frontend interacts with the Machine Learning API to generate housing price forecasts and display long-term analytics.

1. Short-term vs. long-term forecasting

- If the forecast range is ≤ 60 days, the request is handled by the N-Beats short-term model
- If the range is > 60 days, the request is handled by the XGBoost long-term model
- Both models are served by the backend Flask API in my Machine Learning repo

2. ML-generated prediction charts

- The backend returns a PNG plot, which the React app displays as the prediction result

3. 20-year historical analysis dashboard

- The React app embeds a Plotly HTML dashboard generated by the backend, based on 20 years of real estate data for the Magnolia neighborhood in Seattle (not the entire city)

## My Role

In the original team project, I was responsible for integrating the **frontend** with the machine learning prediction services.  
My contributions include:

- Implementing React components that send requests to the Flask-based ML API  
- Handling user inputs (date ranges, filters, bedrooms/bathrooms, property type, etc.)  
- Displaying **prediction plots** returned by the backend (served as PNG images)  
- Embedding **Plotly dashboards** generated by the backend as HTML  
- Managing UI state, loading states, and API errors  
- Ensuring a clean separation between frontend and backend responsibilities  

In short:  
**I connected the React frontend with the ML prediction engine and built the UI/UX to display forecast results**


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with  
👉 https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

Below are the standard development scripts.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open:  
👉 http://localhost:3000  

The page reloads when changes are saved.

---

### `npm test`
Runs tests in watch mode.

---

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.

---

### `npm run eject`
**Warning:** This is irreversible.  
Copies all configuration files so you can customize Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.

## Frontend ↔ Backend Integration

This frontend communicates with the ML backend by sending requests to endpoints such as:

- /predict-nbeats
- /predict-xgboost

The backend returns:

- **PNG forecast charts** → displayed inside React  
- **HTML Plotly dashboards** → embedded into the page  
- **JSON metadata** about the prediction range & model outputs
